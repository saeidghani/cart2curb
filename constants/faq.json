    "question": "How much does it cost?",
    "answer": "To have Cart2Curb drive to your favourite store, pick and pack your order (while you watch with LiveCart, if you want) always costs only **$10 plus 5%** of the order value (eg. a $100 order would come to $115 with Cart 2 Curb – cheaper than taking a cab, and your time is worth so much more!). Also, unlike the big guys, you always get **the true cost of the goods** when ordering through us. That means all **sale/discount/promotional prices**, a picture of the receipt when your order is completed and **LiveCart is included** with all orders! No surprises or markups and the stores we shop from get paid upfront so you can stay home and support local business!"

    "answer": "Yes! With LiveCart you can make changes throughout the shopping experience by letting your shopper know as they go! Even if you don’t use LiveCart as long as you let us know before we checkout at the store we can likely change your order to suit. Once it’s paid for and on the way to you, you’ll get a picture of the itemized final receipt. You only pay for the items that were available so there’s never any surprises!"
